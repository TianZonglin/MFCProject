MFC is a C++ application framework specifically designed for developing Windows applications, and it is tightly integrated with the Visual C++ IDE, which provides the development environment and tools for building MFC-based applications.

This is a collection of MFC applications developed using Visual C++. You can try them directly by executing the *.exe files in the `debug` folder. If you get a notification that your PC is missing certain DLL files, you can copy the required DLLs from this repository to your DLL folder. I'm using a 64-bit system, so I placed them in the `SysWOW64` folder.
